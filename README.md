This is a simple automated theorem prover for Boolean Algebra
that uses deductive reasoning on a set of axioms
and breadth first search.

The grammar for the proving language is at the top of `prover.cpp`.
See examples in `examples.txt`.

Usage (on mac/linux):
```bash
make && ./prover example.txt
```
